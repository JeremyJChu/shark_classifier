# Shark Classifier
Project for FastAI, building and deploying a very basic shark classifer.
Image classification between Great White, Tiger, and Hammerhead sharks with 92% accuracy. Only photos, no drawings.

You can find the classifier [here](https://basic-shark-classifier.herokuapp.com/).
## Goals of the project
  1. Figure out how to deploy on Heroku
  2. Satisfy curiousity in whether tiger sharks can be differentiated with great white sharks (I know nothing about the sharks but they look quite similar in photos). And also whether there are situations in which the previous two sharks would be mis-classified as hammerhead (they did!)

## How to use
Click the link, upload a photo of either a Great White, Tiger, or Hammerhead shark and press classify! 

The Jupyter notebook is also included, so feel free to check out the code.
